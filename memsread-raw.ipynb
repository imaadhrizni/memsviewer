Once the engine is started and begins to warm-up, the coolant becomes hotter, and this causes a change in the CTS resistance. As the CTS becomes hotter, the resistance of the CTS reduces (NTC principle), and this returns a variable voltage signal to the ECM based upon the coolant temperature. The open-circuit supply to the sensor is at a 5v reference level, and this voltage reduces to a value that depends upon the CTS resistance. Normal operating temperature is usually from 80°C to 100°C. The ECM uses the CTS signal as a main correction factor when calculating ignition timing and injection duration.\n",

Because the density of air varies in inverse proportion to the temperature, the ATS signal allows more accurate assessment of the volume of air entering the engine. The open-circuit supply to the sensor is at a 5.0v reference level, and the earth path is through the sensor return. The ATS operates on the NTC principle. A variable voltage signal is returned to the ECM based upon the air temperature. This signal is approximately 2.0 to 3.0 volts at an ambient temperature of 20°C, and reduces to about 1.5v as the temperature rises to around 40°C. Although the air filter casing used on SPi models contains a thermal valve system, the air temperature is calculated solely by reference to the ATS."
