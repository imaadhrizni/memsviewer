**Lambda Max / Min Voltage Fault Indicator**

The lambda reading exceeds the normal operating parameters

The graph should peak at about 900mV (0.9 Volts), dip to about 100mV (0.1 Volts), and 450mV (0.45 Volts) should be the average centre point of the graph. Over the space of 10 seconds, the graph should cross this central 450mV line 7 or 8 times. This corresponds to the ECU doing its cycling back and forth job effectively, and points to a quick and good condition sensor.
