**Map Sensor Fault Indicated**

Map sensor is reading very high, check that the vacuum pipes are not blocked or disconnected, the fuel trap is not blocked or leaking. It is possible that the map sensor inside the ECU is faultly but vacuum pipes are the likely cause. A map sensor fault indicator can cause quite extreme symptoms such as very high revving, stalling and very poor performance.
