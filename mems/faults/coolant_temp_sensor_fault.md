**Coolant temperature sensor fault indicated.**

Check the thermostat is working correctly and replace with an 88C thermostat first. This fault can show as the temperature gauge reading incorrectly. As the coolant heats up to the 88 degC the resistance of the CTS starts to drop. This drop is read by the ECU and the injector timing is varied accordingly, its not a binary on off switch, it varies the injector timing against the ECU map. 

An NTC Thermistor is highly unlikely to fail in the short circuit mode, (ie almost never ever will this be the situation), but will more than likley fail either open circuit or its resistance over time will start to creep up . ie at say 80 degC instead of reporting 200 ohms it might be more like 600-1000 ohms. This tells the ECU that the injector timing needs to be extended. Maybe not full timing but certainly not where it should be. 

Other sensors likely to be affected are the Inlet Air Temperature Sensor and the Throttle Pot. Sensor.
